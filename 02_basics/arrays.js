//arrays
const myArr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,] //jjs have resizable arryas //copy operations creates shallow copies
//shalow copies--> a shaalow copy is a copy whose properties shares the same  references as those  of the source object from which the copy was made  . As a result , when you change either the source or the copy , you may also cause the other object to change too
//deep copies---> a deep copy is a copy whose pperties do noy share the same refrences as those of the source object  from which the copy was made. As a result, when you change either the source or copy, you can be assured you are not causing the others objects too

//array methods

//myArr.push(6) // insert values in array
//myArr.push(7)
//console.log(myArr);
//myArr.pop() //deletes last value

//unshift
//myArr.unshift(9);
//myArr.shift()
//console.log(myArr);

//console.log(myArr.includes(9));
//console.log(myArr.indexOf(3));

//slice and spilce
//slice-----> The slice() method of String values extracts a section of this string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string.
//splice--->The splice() method of Array instances changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place
//console.log("A",myArr);
////const myn1 = myArr.slice(1,3)
//console.log(myn1)
//console.log(myArr);


//console.log("B",myArr);
//console.log(myn1)

//const myn2 = myArr.splice(1,3);
//console.log(myn2);
//console.log(myArr)
